269.1 	 Perimeter 1

269.2 	 What is the perimeter of the square?

269.3 	 The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of the shape added together.

269.4 	 Add up the lengths of the sides:

269.7 	 What is the perimeter of the rectangle?

269.8 	 The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of the shape added together.

269.9 	 Add up the lengths of the sides:

269.12 	 What is the perimeter of the triangle?

269.13 	 The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of the shape added together.

269.14 	 Add up the lengths of the sides:

269.17 	 What is the perimeter of the regular <var>POLYGON</var>?

269.18 	 The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of the shape added together.

269.19 	 All of the sides of a
                        <a href="#" class="show-definition" data-definition="regular-polygon">regular</a>
                        <var>POLYGON</var> are the same length.

269.20 	 Since there are <span class="hint_blue"><code><var>SIDES</var></code> sides</span>
                        that are all <span class="hint_green"><code><var>S</var></code>
                        <var>plural(UNIT_TEXT)</var></span> long, we can multiply:

269.23 	 What is the perimeter of the shape? Each square in the grid is
                a <code>1 \times 1</code> <var>UNIT_TEXT</var> square.

269.24 	 The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of the
                    shape added together.

269.25 	 Add up the lengths of all <var>SHAPE.numSides</var>
                        sides.

269.27 	 The perimeter is <code><var>SHAPE.perimeter</var></code>
                    <var>plural(UNIT_TEXT)</var>.
