222.1 	 Mean median and mode

222.2 	 What is the arithmetic mean of the following numbers?

222.4 	 To find the mean, add all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers.

222.5 	 There are <code><var>INTEGERS_COUNT</var></code> numbers.

222.6 	 The mean is <code>\displaystyle <var>fractionSimplification( sum(INTEGERS), INTEGERS_COUNT )</var></code>.

222.7 	 What is the median of the following numbers?

222.9 	 First, order the numbers, giving:

222.10 	 Since we have <code>2</code> middle numbers, the median is the mean of <strong>those</strong> two numbers!

222.11 	 The median is the 'middle' number:

222.12 	 The median is <code>\dfrac{<var>SORTED_INTS[ SORTED_INTS.length / 2 - 1 ]</var> + <var>SORTED_INTS[ SORTED_INTS.length / 2 ]</var>}{2}</code>.

222.13 	 So the median is <code><var>fractionReduce(2 * MEDIAN, 2)</var></code>.

222.14 	 Another way to find the middle number is to draw the numbers on a number line. If a number appears multiple times, count its corresponding dot multiple times.

222.15 	 What is the mode of the following numbers?

222.17 	 The mode is the most frequent number.

222.18 	 We can draw a histogram to see how many times each number appears.

222.19 	 There are more <code><var>MODE</var></code>s than any other number, so <code><var>MODE</var></code> is the mode.
