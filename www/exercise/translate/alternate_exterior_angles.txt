26.1 	 Alternate exterior angles

26.2 	 The two horizontal lines are parallel, and there is a third line that intersects them as shown below.

26.3 	 If we know that the <span class="hint_blue">blue angle is <var>MEASURE</var> degrees</span>, what is the <span class="hint_orange">measure of the orange angle</span>?

26.5 	 Opposite angles are equal, so the pink angle measures <var>MEASURE</var> degrees.

26.6 	 The pink and orange angles are corresponding angles, so they are also equal.

26.7 	 The orange angle measures <var>MEASURE</var> degrees.
