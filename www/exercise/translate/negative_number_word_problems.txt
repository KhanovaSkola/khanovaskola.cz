246.2 	 {This afternoon, an outdoor temperature had a reading of|On a cold February afternoon, the temperature outside was} <var>abs( X )</var> degrees below zero. {By evening, the temperature had dropped by|In the evening, you take a quick look at the thermometer, and see that the temperature had dropped by} <var>Y</var> degrees.

246.3 	 What was the temperature in the evening?

246.4 	 <span class="sol" data-forms="integer"><var>Z</var></span> degrees

246.5 	 <code><var>abs( X )</var></code> degrees below zero is the same as <code><var>X</var>^{\circ}</code>.

246.6 	 Since the temperature dropped by <code><var>Y</var>^{\circ}</code>, subtract this amount from the afternoon temperature.

246.8 	 The temperature in the evening was <code><var>Z</var>^{\circ}</code>.

246.9 	 {When <var>person( 1 )</var> went outside to go sledding in the morning|As <var>person( 1 )</var> prepared for <var>his( 1 )</var> daily sledding practice}, <var>he( 1 )</var> {looked at the thermometer and saw|heard on the radio} that the temperature was <var>abs( X )</var> degrees below zero. {After sledding for <var>plural( randRange( 1, 8 ), "hour" )</var>,|After a long day of sledding <var>he( 1 )</var> saw that} the temperature was now <var>Z</var> degrees.

246.10 	 By how many degrees had the temperature increased?

246.11 	 <span class="sol" data-forms="integer"><var>Y</var></span> degrees

246.12 	 <code><var>abs( X )</var></code> degrees below zero is the same as <code><var>X</var>^{\circ}</code>.

246.13 	 Change in temperature = final temperature - initial temperature

246.14 	 Change in temperature = <code><var>Z</var>^{\circ} - (<var>X</var>^{\circ}) = <var>Z</var>^{\circ} - <var>X</var>^{\circ} = <var>Y</var>^{\circ}</code>

246.15 	 The temperature had increased by <code><var>Y</var>^{\circ}</code>.

246.16 	 <var>person( 1 )</var> was scuba diving <var>X</var> meters below sea level when <var>he( 1 )</var> spotted a beautiful fish below. {From a distance, the fish looked to be about <var>randRange( 25, 35 )</var> cm wide. |}{To take a proper photograph|To see the fish up close}, <var>person( 1 )</var> dove <var>Y</var> meters until <var>he( 1 )</var> was level with the fish, staring into its eyes.

246.17 	 Where was the fish relative to sea level?

246.18 	 <span class="sol" data-forms="integer"><var>Z</var></span> meters

246.19 	 <var>person( 1 )</var> was initially <code><var>X</var></code> meters below sea level, which can be written as a negative number, <code>-<var>X</var></code> meters.

246.20 	 <var>person( 1 )</var> dove down <code><var>Y</var></code> meters, so we can subtract that distance from <var>person( 1 )</var>’s initial level to find out where the fish is.

246.21 	 Fish’s position relative to sea level <code>=-<var>X</var>\text{ meters} - <var>Y</var>\text{ meters} = <var>Z</var>\text{ meters}</code>

246.22 	 A spinner dolphin jumped from <var>X</var> meters below sea level and flipped through the air at <var>Y</var> meters above sea level. {The jump itself took about 1.<var>randRange( 1, 9 )</var> seconds.|}

246.23 	 How many meters did the dolphin travel to reach the highest point of the jump?

246.24 	 <span class="sol" data-forms="integer"><var>Z</var></span> meters

246.25 	 The dolphin was initially <var>X</var> meters below sea level, which can be written as a negative number, -<var>X</var> meters.

246.26 	 Distance the dolphin jumped = final position - initial position

246.28 	 <var>person( 1 )</var> received a loan of $<var>commafy( X )</var> from the bank to start a baseball camp. <var>person( 1 )</var> used the loan to rent baseball bats, mitts, and baseballs for the summer, and to pay the coaches’ salaries. Over the course of the summer, <var>N</var> campers attended <var>person( 1 )</var>’s baseball camp, and each camper paid a fee of $<var>COST</var> to attend. <var>person( 1 )</var> used all of the money from the campers’ fees to start paying back the loan.

246.29 	 At the end of the summer what was <var>person( 1 )</var>'s net worth, assuming <var>he( 1 )</var> had no other assets or liabilities?

246.30 	 <var>person( 1 )</var> started out the summer with <code>$<var>commafy( X )</var></code> of debt, which can be represented as a negative number, <code>-$<var>commafy( X )</var></code>.

246.31 	 Amount of money <var>person( 1 )</var> earned from campers = <code><var>N</var> \times $<var>COST</var>=$<var>commafy(  Y )</var></code>

246.32 	 debt + earnings = <var>person( 1 )</var>'s account balance
