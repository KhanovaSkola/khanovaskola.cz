270.1 	 Perimeter of squares and rectangles

270.2 	 One side of a square is <code><var>S</var></code>
                <var>plural(UNIT_TEXT, S)</var> long. What is its perimeter?

270.3 	 The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of the
                    shape added together.

270.4 	 Add up the lengths of the sides:

270.7 	 The perimeter of a square is <code><var>4 * S</var></code>
                <var>plural(UNIT_TEXT)</var>. How long is each side?

270.8 	 The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of
                        the shape added together.

270.11 	 The sides of a square are all the same length, so each
                        side must be <code><var>S</var></code>
                        <var>plural(UNIT_TEXT, S)</var> long.

270.12 	 A rectangle is
                <code><var>L</var></code> <var>plural(UNIT_TEXT, L)</var>
                long and
                <code><var>W</var></code> <var>plural(UNIT_TEXT, W)</var>
                wide. What is its perimeter?

270.13 	 The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of the
                    shape added together.

270.14 	 Add up the lengths of the sides:
