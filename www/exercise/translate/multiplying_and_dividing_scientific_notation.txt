235.1 	 Multiplying and dividing scientific notation

235.2 	 Express this quotient in scientific notation:
                    <code>\Large{\frac{<var>scientific( 3, NUMERATOR )</var>}
                    {<var>scientific( 1, DENOMINATOR )</var>}}</code>

235.3 	 Start by collecting like terms together.

235.5 	 Then divide each term seperately. When dividing exponents with the same base, subtract their powers.

235.8 	 To write the answer correctly in scientific notation, the first number needs to be between <code>1</code> and <code>10</code>.
                            In this case, we need to move the decimal one position to the right without changing the value of our answer.

235.9 	 <code>\qquad</code>We can use the fact that
                            <code><var>roundTo( 2, scientificMantissa( 3, NUMERATOR ) / scientificMantissa( 1, DENOMINATOR ) ).toFixed( 2 )</var></code> is the same as
                            <code><var>scientificMantissa( 2, QUOTIENT )</var> \div 10</code>, or
                            <code class="hint_blue"><var>scientificMantissa( 2, QUOTIENT )</var> \times 10^{-1}</code>.

235.12 	 Express this product in scientific notation:
                    <code>(<var>scientific( 2, QUOTIENT )</var>)\times (<var>scientific( 2, DENOMINATOR )</var>)</code>

235.13 	 Start by collecting like terms together.

235.15 	 When multiplying exponents with the same base, add the powers together.

235.18 	 To write the answer correctly in scientific notation, the first number needs to be between <code>1</code> and <code>10</code>.
                            In this case, we need to move the decimal one position to the left without changing the value of our answer.

235.19 	 <code>\qquad</code>We can use the fact that
                            <code><var>roundTo( 1, scientificMantissa( 2, QUOTIENT ) * scientificMantissa( 1, DENOMINATOR ) ).toFixed( 1 )</var></code> is the same as
                            <code class="hint_blue"><var>scientificMantissa( 3, NUMERATOR )</var> \times 10</code>.
