77.1 	 Congruent Triangles 2

77.2 	 These two triangles have three sides equal (they share one of them).

77.3 	 Therefore they are congruent.

77.4 	 Congruent triangles also have congruent (equal) angles.

77.5 	 If we superimpose these two triangles, by rotating triangle ABC, we see that angle x corresponds to angle <var>ANGLE_LABELS[ ANG_LEFT ]</var>

77.6 	 Angle x is therefore equal to <var>ANSWER</var>.

77.7 	 These two triangles have three sides equal (they share one of them).

77.8 	 Therefore they are congruent.

77.9 	 Congruent triangles also have congruent (equal) angles.

77.10 	 If we superimpose these two triangles, by rotating triangle ABC, we see that angle x corresponds to angle <var>ANGLE_LABELS[ ANG_LEFT ]</var>.

77.13 	 These two triangles have two sides and an angle equal.

77.14 	 Therefore they are congruent.

77.15 	 Congruent triangles also have congruent (equal) angles.

77.16 	 If we superimpose these two triangles, by flipping triangle <code>EDA</code>, we see that angle x corresponds to angle <var>ANGLE_LABELS[ SHOW_ANGLE ]</var>

77.19 	 Angle x is therefore equal to <var>ANSWER</var>
