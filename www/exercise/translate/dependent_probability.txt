100.1 	 Dependent probability

100.2 	 You have <code><var>NUM_COINS</var></code> coins in a bag. <code><var>NUM_UNFAIR_COINS</var></code> of them are unfair in that they have a <code><var>PERCENT_CHANCE_UNFAIR_HEADS</var>\%</code> chance of coming up heads when flipped (the rest are fair coins). You randomly choose one coin from the bag and flip it <code><var>NUM_FLIPS</var></code> times.

100.3 	 What is the probability, written as a percentage, of getting <code><var>NUM_FLIPS</var></code> heads? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a percent.

100.5 	 You can only pick a fair coin or pick an unfair coin. There is no other outcome.

100.6 	 What chance do you have of picking an unfair coin? How about a fair coin?

100.7 	 An unfair coin occurs <code class="unfair"><var>UNFAIR_COIN_FRACTION_STRING</var></code> of the time.

100.8 	 A fair coin occurs the rest of the time, or <code class="unfair"><var>FAIR_COIN_FRACTION_STRING</var></code> of the time.

100.9 	 For that <code class="unfair"><var>UNFAIR_COIN_FRACTION_STRING</var></code> of the time that you pick an unfair coin,
            what is the chance of flipping <code class="unfair"><var>NUM_FLIPS</var></code> heads using that unfair coin?

100.10 	 The chance is <code class="unfair"><var>UNFAIR_HEADS_PERCENT_FORMULA</var></code>, or
            <code class="unfair"><var>UNFAIR_HEADS_DECIMAL_FORMULA</var></code>.

100.11 	 Now, then, your chance of both picking the unfair coin and also flipping
            <code class="unfair"><var>NUM_FLIPS</var></code> heads--the chance that both these events occur--is what?

100.12 	 It is <code class="unfair"><var>UNFAIR_COIN_FRACTION_STRING</var> \times <var>UNFAIR_HEADS_DECIMAL_FORMULA</var></code>.

100.13 	 Now, the other possibility, picking the fair coin and flipping <code class="fair"><var>NUM_FLIPS</var></code> heads is what?

100.14 	 It is <code class="fair"><var>FAIR_COIN_FRACTION_STRING</var> \times <var>FAIR_HEADS_DECIMAL_FORMULA</var></code>.

100.15 	 How do you combine these two mutually exclusive events to find the chance that either occurs?

100.16 	 Add them! So your answer is
                <code class="unfair"><var>UNFAIR_COIN_FRACTION_STRING</var> \times <var>UNFAIR_HEADS_DECIMAL_FORMULA</var></code>+
                <code class="fair"><var>FAIR_COIN_FRACTION_STRING</var> \times <var>FAIR_HEADS_DECIMAL_FORMULA</var></code>, or
                <code><var>ANSWER</var>\%</code>.
