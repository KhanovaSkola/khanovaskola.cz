146.1 	 Exponents 1

146.2 	 This exercise covers exponential arithmetic with, in general, integer bases raised to nonnegative integer exponents. Handles three specific cases: integers raised to positive integers (this is the most common case); nonzero integers raised to 0; and -1, 0, and 1 raised to arbitrarily large positive integers. This exercise covers all the material presented in the Level 1 Exponents video.
