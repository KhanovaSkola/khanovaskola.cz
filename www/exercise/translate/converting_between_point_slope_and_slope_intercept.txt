79.1 	 Converting between point slope and slope intercept form

79.2 	 Convert the following equation from point slope to slope intercept form.

79.3 	 In other words, if the equation is rewritten to look like <code>y = mx + b</code>, what are the values of <code>m</code> and <code>b</code>?

79.5 	 <code>y = \space</code><span class="sol"><var>m</var></span><code>\space \cdot x + \space</code><span class="sol"><var>b</var></span>

79.6 	 Distribute the <code><var>m</var></code> in the <code class="hint_blue"><var>m</var>(x - <var>x1</var>)</code> term on the right.

79.8 	 Isolate the y term on the left by
                        <span data-if="y1 < 0">subtracting <code><var>-y1</var></code> from both sides.</span>
                        <span data-else>adding <code><var>y1</var></code> to both sides.</span>

79.10 	 Combine the constant terms on the right.

79.12 	 The equation is now in slope-intercept form, with a slope of <code><var>m</var></code> and a y-intercept of <code><var>b</var></code>.
