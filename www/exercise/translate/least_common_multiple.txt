204.1 	 Least common multiple

204.2 	 What is the least common multiple of <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>?

204.3 	 Another way to say this is:

204.6 	 The least common multiple is the smallest number that is a multiple of <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>.

204.7 	 We know that <var>A</var> x <var>B</var> (or <var>PRODUCT</var>) is a common multiple,
                but is it the least common multiple?

204.8 	 Write out the multiples of <var>BIGGER</var> until we find a number divisible by <var>SMALLER</var>.

204.9 	 So, <var>LCM</var> is the least common multiple of <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>.
