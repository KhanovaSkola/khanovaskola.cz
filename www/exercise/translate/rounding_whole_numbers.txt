317.1 	 Rounding whole numbers

317.2 	 Round <code><var>commafy( NUM )</var></code> to the nearest <var>TPLACE</var>.

317.3 	 Round <code><var>commafy( NUM )</var></code> to the nearest <var>TPLACE</var>.

317.4 	 There are two ways to think about this problem.

317.5 	 1st way: Look at the <var>placesLeftOfDecimal[ -1 - PLACE ]</var>s digit <code><var>DIGITS[ 5 + PLACE ]</var></code> to see whether to round up or down.

317.6 	 Because it is <span data-if="DIGITS[ 5 + PLACE ] > 5">more than</span><span data-else>equal to</span> <code>5</code>, we round up, giving <code><var>commafy( ROUNDED )</var></code>.

317.7 	 Because it is less than <code>5</code>, we round down, giving <code><var>commafy( ROUNDED )</var></code>.

317.8 	 2nd way:  Consider which end of the number line is closer to <var>NUM</var> - this end is circled in blue.
