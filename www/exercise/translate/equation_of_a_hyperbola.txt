132.1 	 Equation of a hyperbola

132.2 	 The equation of hyperbola <code>H</code> is <code><var>WHICH_NEG === 1 ? expr(["-", Y2T, X2T]) : expr(["-", X2T, Y2T])</var> = 1</code>.

132.3 	 What are the asymptotes?

132.4 	 <code>y = \pm (</code><span class="sol" data-fallback="1"><var>B/A</var></span>
                    <code>)(x + </code><span class="sol" data-fallback="0"><var>-H</var></span>
                    <code>) + </code><span class="sol" data-fallback="0"><var>K</var></span>

132.5 	 enter integers, <em>simplified</em> fractions, or <em>exact</em> decimals for each term

132.6 	 pay attention to the sign of each number you enter to be sure the entire equation is correct

132.7 	 We want to rewrite the equation in terms of <code>y</code>, so start off by moving the <code>y</code> terms to one side:

132.9 	 Multiply both sides of the equation by <code><var>B * B</var></code>.

132.11 	 Take the square root of both sides.

132.14 	 As <code>x</code> approaches positive or negative infinity, the constant term in the square root matters less and less, so we can just ignore it.

132.17 	 <span data-if="K > 0">Add <code><var>K</var></code> to both sides and rewrite</span>
                <span data-else-if="K < 0">Subtract <code><var>-K</var></code> from both sides and rewrite</span>
                <span data-else>Rewrite</span>
                as an equality in terms of <code>y</code> to get the equation of the asymptotes:
