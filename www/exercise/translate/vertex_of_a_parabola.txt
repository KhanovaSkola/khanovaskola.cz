387.1 	 Vertex of a parabola

387.2 	 Given the equation:

387.4 	 Find the parabola's vertex.

387.6 	 When the equation is rewritten in vertex form like this, the vertex is the point <code class="hint_green">(h, k)</code>:
                    <p><code>\qquad <var>formatGroup( GROUP1, [ 0 ] )</var></code>

387.7 	 We can rewrite the equation in vertex form by completing the square. First, move the constant term to the left side of the equation:

387.9 	 Next, we can factor out a <code><var>A</var></code> from the right side:

387.11 	 We can complete the square by taking half of the coefficient of our x term, squaring it, and adding it to both sides of the equation.
                    The coefficient of our x term is <code><var>-2 * H</var></code>, so half of it would be <code><var>-H</var></code>,
                    and squaring that gives us <code class="hint_blue"><var>H * H</var></code>. <span data-if="A !== 1">Because we're adding the <code><var>H * H</var></code>
                    inside the parentheses on the right where it's being multiplied by <code><var>A</var></code>, we need to add <code class="hint_blue"><var>A * H * H</var></code>
                    to the left side to make sure we're adding the same thing to both sides.</span>

387.13 	 Now we can rewrite the expression in parentheses as a squared term:

387.15 	 Move the constant term to the right side of the equation. Now the equation is in vertex form:

387.17 	 Now that the equation is written in vertex form, the vertex is the point <code class="hint_green">(h, k)</code>:

387.19 	 The vertex is <code>(<var>H</var>, <var>K</var>)</code>. Be sure to pay attention to the signs when interpreting an equation in vertex form.
