375.1 	 Triangle Types

375.2 	 We know two angles of this triangle, so we can find the third by subtracting from <code>180</code>

375.4 	 Because all three angles are different, this triangle is scalene.

375.5 	 Two angles are the same, therefore two corresponding sides are as well. Therefore, this triangle is isosceles. Isosceles means a triangle with same (iso) legs (sceles).

375.6 	 All angles equal 60. That means that all the sides are the same and that the triangle is equilateral. (Equilateral means equal(equi) sided(lateral).

375.7 	 Because all three sides are different, this triangle is scalene.

375.8 	 Two sides are the same, therefore, this triangle is isosceles. Isosceles means a triangle with same (iso) legs (sceles).

375.9 	 All sides are the same. That means that all the angles are 60 and that the triangle is equilateral. Equilateral means equal (equi) sided (lateral).
