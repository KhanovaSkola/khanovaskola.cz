109.1 	 Dividing complex numbers

109.2 	 Divide the following complex numbers. You can round the real and imaginary parts of the result to 2 decimal digits.

109.4 	 Complex number division is converted to complex multiplication using the denominator's complex conjugate.

109.6 	 The denominator is simplified by <code>(a + b) \cdot (a - b) = a^2 - b^2</code>.

109.7 	 Note that the denominator now doesn't contain any imaginary unit multiples, so it is a real number, simplifying the problem to complex number multiplication.<br />

109.8 	 The squares in the denominator are evaluated and subtracted.

109.9 	 Afterwards, the numerator is multiplied using the distributive property.

109.10 	 All multiplications are evaluated.

109.11 	 Finally, the fraction is simplified.

109.12 	 The real part of the result is <code><var>REAL_FRACTION</var></code>, which is (rounded to 2 decimal places) <code><var>ANSWER_REAL</var></code>.

109.13 	 The imaginary part of the result is <code><var>IMAG_FRACTION</var></code>, which is (rounded to 2 decimal places) <code><var>ANSWER_IMAG</var></code>.
