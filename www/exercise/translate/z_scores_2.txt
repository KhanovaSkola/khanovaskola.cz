394.1 	 Z-scores 2: Reading a z-table

394.2 	 <var>person(1)</var>'s exam grade was higher than what percentage
            of test-takers? Use the cumulative z-table provided below. Round to two decimal places.

394.3 	 A cumulative z-table shows the probability that a standard normal variable will be
                    <b>less than</b> a certain value <b>(z)</b>.

394.4 	 In order to use the z-table, we first need to determine the
                    <span class="hint_blue">z-score</span> of <var>person( 1 )</var>'s exam grade.

394.5 	 Recall that we can calculate <var>his( 1 )</var> z-score by subtracting the
                        <span class="hint_pink">mean <code>(\mu)</code></span> from <var>his(1)</var>
                        grade and then dividing by the <span class="hint_green">standard deviation
                        <code>(\sigma)</code></span>.

394.7 	 Look up <code><var>ZSCORE</var></code> on the z-table. This value,
                        <code class="hint_blue"><var>ANSWER</var></code>, represents
                        the portion of the population that scored lower than
                        <code><var>GRADE</var></code> on the exam.

394.8 	 <var>person( 1 )</var> scored higher than
                    <code class="hint_blue"><var>roundTo(2, ANSWER * 100)</var>\%</code> of the
                    test-takers on the <var>course( 1 )</var> exam.
