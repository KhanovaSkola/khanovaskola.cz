108.1 	 Distributive property with variables

108.3 	 Use the distributive property to simplify the expression.

108.5 	 Distribute across the parenthesis.

108.7 	 A negative sign before an expression is the same as -1 times that expression.

108.11 	 You're done!

108.12 	 Remember that the <em>distributive property</em> shows that multiplying an expression involving addition (or subtraction) by <code>x</code> is the same thing as multiplying each term of the expression by <code>x</code> before performing the addition.
                        <p><code>x(y + z) = xy + xz</code>
