300.1 	 Rate problems 2

300.2 	 Starting at home, <var>person( 1 )</var> traveled uphill to the <var>store( 1 )</var> store for <var>TIME_UP</var> minutes at just <var>RATE_UP</var> mph. <var>He( 1 )</var> then traveled back home along the same path downhill at a speed of <var>K * RATE_UP</var> mph.

300.3 	 What is <var>his( 1 )</var> average speed for the entire trip from home to the <var>store( 1 )</var> store and back?

300.4 	 The average speed is not just the average of <var>RATE_UP</var> mph and <var>RATE_DOWN</var> mph.

300.5 	 <var>He( 1 )</var> traveled for a longer time uphill (since <var>he( 1 )</var> was going slower), so we can estimate that the average speed is closer to <var>RATE_UP</var> mph than <var>RATE_DOWN</var> mph.

300.6 	 To calculate the average speed, we will make use of the following:

300.9 	 What was the total distance traveled?

300.12 	 Substituting to find the total distance:

300.14 	 What was the total time spent traveling?

300.18 	 Now that we know both the total distance and total time, we can find the average speed.

300.20 	 The average speed is <var>RATE_AVG</var> mph, and which is closer to <var>RATE_UP</var> mph than <var>RATE_DOWN</var> mph as we expected.

300.21 	 It takes <var>TIME_INIT</var> minutes for <var>PEOPLE_INIT</var> people to paint <var>WALL_INIT</var> walls.

300.22 	 How many minutes does it take <var>PEOPLE_FINAL</var> people to paint <var>WALL_FINAL</var> walls?

300.23 	 Imagine that each person is assigned one wall, and all <var>PEOPLE_INIT</var> people begin painting at the same time.

300.24 	 Since everyone will finish painting their assigned wall after <var>TIME_INIT</var> minutes, it takes one person <var>TIME_INIT</var> minutes to paint one wall.

300.25 	 If we have <var>PEOPLE_FINAL</var> people and <var>WALL_FINAL</var> walls, we can again assign one wall to each person.

300.26 	 Everyone will take <var>TIME_FINAL</var> minutes to paint their assigned wall.

300.27 	 In other words, it takes <var>TIME_FINAL</var> minutes for <var>PEOPLE_FINAL</var> people to paint <var>WALL_FINAL</var> walls.

300.28 	 <var>PEOPLE_INIT</var> people can paint <var>WALL_INIT</var> walls in <var>TIME_INIT</var> minutes.

300.29 	 How many minutes will it take for <var>PEOPLE_FINAL</var> people to paint <var>WALL_FINAL</var> walls? Round to the nearest minute.

300.30 	 the number of minutes, rounded to the nearest minute

300.31 	 We know the following about the number of walls <code>w</code> painted by <code>p</code> people in <code>t</code> minutes at a constant rate <code>r</code>.

300.34 	 Substituting known values and solving for <code>r</code>:

300.36 	 We can now calculate the amount of time to paint <var>WALL_FINAL</var> walls with <var>PEOPLE_FINAL</var> people.

300.37 	 <code>t = \dfrac{w}{r \cdot p} = \dfrac{<var>WALL_FINAL</var>}{<var>fractionReduce( WALL_INIT, TIME_INIT * PEOPLE_INIT )</var> \cdot <var>PEOPLE_FINAL</var>} = \dfrac{<var>WALL_FINAL</var>}{<var>fractionReduce( WALL_INIT * PEOPLE_FINAL, TIME_INIT * PEOPLE_INIT )</var>} = <var>fractionReduce( WALL_FINAL * TIME_INIT * PEOPLE_INIT, WALL_INIT * PEOPLE_FINAL )</var>\text{ minutes}</code><span data-if="NEED_TO_ROUND"><code>= <var>mixedFractionFromImproper( WALL_FINAL * TIME_INIT * PEOPLE_INIT, WALL_INIT * PEOPLE_FINAL, true, true )</var>\text{ minutes}</code></span>
