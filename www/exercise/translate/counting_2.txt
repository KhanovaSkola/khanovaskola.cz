93.1 	 Counting 2

93.2 	 <var>person( 1 )</var> starts counting at <var>START</var>, and <var>he( 1 )</var> counts by <var>cardinal( INCR )</var>s.

93.3 	 If <var>START</var> is the 1st number that <var>person( 1 )</var> counts. what is the <var>NTH</var>th number that <var>he( 1 )</var> counts?

93.5 	 What is the first number that <var>he( 1 )</var> counts?

93.7 	 What is the second number that <var>he( 1 )</var> counts?

93.9 	 What is the third number that <var>he( 1 )</var> counts?

93.11 	 What is the <var>NTH</var>th number that <var>he( 1 )</var> counts?

93.13 	 There are <var>NUM</var> people in a room.

93.14 	 If everyone shakes everyone else's hand exactly once, how many handshakes occurred?

93.16 	 Given <var>NUM</var> people, each person shakes the hands of <var>NUM - 1</var> other people.

93.17 	 The following is almost the answer.

93.19 	 We have double counted the handshakes though, since <var>person( 1 )</var> shaking <var>person( 2 )</var>'s hand is the same handshake as <var>person( 2 )</var> shaking <var>person( 1 )</var>'s hand.

93.20 	 Therefore, the following is the correct answer.

93.22 	 <var>person( 1 )</var> wants to give <var>his( 1 )</var> friend a potted plant. At the local florist, the flowers come in <var>NUM_COLORS</var> colors, and there are <var>NUM_POTS</var> types of flower pots.

93.23 	 If <var>he( 1 )</var> can choose any flower and any pot, how many different potted plants can <var>person( 1 )</var> buy?

93.25 	 If <var>person( 1 )</var> decided on a flower color, how many different potted plant combinations are there?

93.26 	 <var>He( 1 )</var> can choose one of <var>NUM_POTS</var> flower pots, and so there are <var>NUM_POTS</var> different potted plants possible (given that <var>he( 1 )</var> already chose a flower color).

93.27 	 Since there are <var>NUM_COLORS</var> flower colors, there are <code><var>NUM_COLORS</var> \times <var>NUM_POTS</var> = <var>ANSWER</var></code> possible potted plants.
