284.1 	 Properties of numbers 2

284.4 	 Any real number multiplied by <code>1</code> equals itself.

284.5 	 Without performing any multiplication steps, we know that <code><var>NUM</var> \times 1 = <var>NUM</var></code>.

284.6 	 This fact about multiplying by <code>1</code> is known as the identity property of multiplication, and it is useful for finding equivalent fractions.

284.9 	 Any real number plus <code>0</code> equals itself.

284.10 	 Without performing any addition steps, we know that <code><var>NUM</var> + 0 = <var>NUM</var></code>.

284.11 	 This fact about adding by <code>0</code> is known as the identity property of addition.

284.12 	 By what number can we multiply <code><var>NUM</var></code> to get <code>1</code>?

284.14 	 Any real number <code>x</code> (except <code>0</code>) can be multipled by <code>\dfrac{1}{x}</code> to get <code>1</code>.

284.15 	 Without performing any multiplication or division, we know that <code><var>NUM</var> \times \dfrac{1}{<var>NUM</var>} = 1</code>.

284.16 	 Thus, the answer is <code>\dfrac{1}{<var>NUM</var>}</code>.

284.17 	 This fact about multiplying by <code>\dfrac{1}{x}</code> is known as the multiplicative inverse property.

        <div id="additive-inverse">
            <p class="question">What number can we add to <code><var>NUM</var></code> to get <code>0</code>?

284.19 	 Adding the negative inverse of a number to that number equals <code>0</code>.

284.20 	 Without performing any addition or subtraction, we know that <code><var>NUM</var> +(<var>-1 * NUM</var>) = 0</code>.

284.21 	 Thus, the answer is <code><var>-1 * NUM</var></code>.

284.22 	 This fact about adding negative inverses is known as the additive inverse property.
