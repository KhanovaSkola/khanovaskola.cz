51.1 	 Changing fractions to percents

51.2 	 Express <code><var>fraction( _N, _D )</var></code> as a percent.

51.3 	 When the denominator is 100, you can simply take the numerator and apply the % sign:

51.4 	 <code><var>fraction( _N, _D )</var></code> = <var>100 * DEC</var>%

51.5 	 <code><var>fraction( _N, _D )</var></code> reduces to <code><var>fraction( N, D )</var></code>.

51.6 	 To turn a fraction into a percent, turn the fraction into a decimal and then multiply the decimal by 100.

51.7 	 Denominators of 10 are an easy case: The decimal form is just the numerator with the decimal place moved left by the number of 0s in the denominator - in this case 1 place.

51.8 	 To turn <code><var>fraction( N, D )</var></code> into a decimal, perform long division, dividing <code><var>D</var></code> into <code><var>N</var></code> (if you need help with this, try practicing some Division exercises or watching some related videos).

51.10 	 To convert this decimal into a percent, we need to multiply it by 100.
