275.1 	 Points, lines, and planes

275.2 	 

275.3 	 What is another way to name plane <code>\mathcal{<var>R</var>}</code>?

275.4 	 Plane <span class="entry"></span>

275.5 	 Planes can be named with three <a href="#" class="show-definition" data-definition="noncollinear">noncollinear</a> points.

275.6 	 Find any three points in the plane <code>\mathcal{<var>R</var>}</code> that are
                    not on the same line and list them in any order.

275.7 	 For example, we can write <code>\mathcal{<var>R</var>}</code> as plane
                    <code><var>A + B + E</var></code>, plane <code><var>A + C + E</var></code>,
                    or plane <code><var>B + E + C</var></code>.

275.8 	 What is another way to name line <code>\ell</code>?

275.9 	 Lines are named using any two points on the line. The order doesn't matter.

275.10 	 The points must have the <code>\leftrightarrow</code> above because we're
                naming a line, not a ray or a segment.

275.11 	 Another way to name line <code>\ell</code> is <code><var>SOLUTION</var></code>.

275.12 	 Are the points <var>toSentence(POINTS)</var> collinear?

275.13 	 Collinear means that they lie on the same line.

275.14 	 Can you draw a straight line through points <var>toSentence(POINTS)</var>?

275.15 	 Yes, points <var>toSentence(POINTS)</var> are collinear.

275.16 	 No, points <var>toSentence(POINTS)</var> are not collinear.

275.17 	 Are the points <var>toSentence(POINTS)</var> collinear?

275.18 	 Through any two points, there is exactly one line.

275.19 	 Points can be collinear even if the line isn't drawn in the figure.

275.20 	 Can you draw a straight line through points <var>toSentence(POINTS)</var>?
                Actually, can you draw a straight line through any two points?

275.21 	 Yes, points <var>toSentence(POINTS)</var> are collinear.

275.22 	 Are the points <var>toSentence(POINTS)</var> coplanar?

275.24 	 Coplanar points are points that all lie on the same plane.

275.25 	 Can a flat surface pass through all the points without bending?

275.26 	 No, any flat surface that includes three of the points won't include the fourth.
                    For example, points <var>toSentence(COPLANAR)</var> are in plane
                    <code>\mathcal{<var>R</var>}</code>, but point <var>D</var> is not.

275.27 	 Yes, points <var>toSentence(POINTS)</var> all lie within a single
                    flat surface. In this case, plane <code>\mathcal{<var>R</var>}</code>.

275.28 	 Yes, there is always at least one flat surface that passes through
                    any three points.
