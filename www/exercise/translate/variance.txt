386.1 	 Variance

386.2 	 You have found the following ages (in years) of all <var>plural( DATA_POINTS, animal( 1 ) )</var> at your local zoo:

386.4 	 What is the average age of the <var>plural( animal( 1 ) )</var> at your zoo? What is the variance?
                    You may round your answers to the nearest tenth.

386.7 	 Because we have data for all <var>plural( DATA_POINTS, animal( 1 ) )</var> at the zoo, we are able
                        to calculate the <span class="hint_blue">population mean</span>
                        <code>(\color{<var>BLUE</var>}{\mu})</code> and
                        <span class="hint_pink">population variance</span> <code>(\color{<var>PINK</var>}{\sigma^2})</code>.

386.8 	 To find the <span class="hint_blue">population mean</span>, add up the values of all <code class="hint_green"><var>DATA_POINTS</var></code>
                            ages and divide by <code class="hint_green"><var>DATA_POINTS</var></code>.

386.11 	 Find the <span class="hint_purple">squared deviations from the mean</span> for each <var>animal(1)</var>.

386.12 	 Because we used the <span class="hint_blue">population mean</span><code>(\color{<var>BLUE</var>}{\mu})</code> to compute the
                            <span class="hint_purple">squared deviations from the mean</span>, we can find the <span class="hint_red">variance</span>
                            <code>(\color{red}{\sigma^2})</code>, without introducing any bias, by simply averaging the
                            <span class="hint_purple">squared deviations from the mean</span>:

386.16 	 <strong>
                        The average <var>animal( 1 )</var> at the zoo is <var>plural( MEAN, "year" )</var> old, and the population variance
                        is <var>plural( VARIANCE_POP, "year" )</var><code>^2</code>.
                    </strong>

386.17 	 You have found the following ages (in years) of <var>plural( DATA_POINTS, animal( 1 ) )</var>
                        randomly selected from the <var>plural( POPULATION, animal( 1 ) )</var> at your local zoo:

386.19 	 Based on your sample, what is the average age of the <var>plural( animal( 1 ) )</var>? What is the variance?
                    You may round your answers to the nearest tenth.

386.20 	 Average age:
                        <span class="sol short" data-type="decimal" data-inexact data-max-error="0.15"><var>mean( DATA )</var></span> years old

386.21 	 Variance:
                        <span class="sol short" data-type="decimal" data-inexact data-max-error="0.15"><var>sum( SQR_DEV ) / ( DATA_POINTS - 1 )</var></span> years<code>^2</code>

386.22 	 Because we only have data for a small sample of the <var>plural( POPULATION, animal( 1 ) )</var>, we are only able
                        to estimate the population mean and variance by finding the <span class="hint_blue">sample mean</span>
                        <code>(\color{<var>BLUE</var>}{\overline{x}})</code> and
                        <span class="hint_pink">sample variance</span> <code>(\color{<var>PINK</var>}{s^2})</code>.

386.23 	 To find the <span class="hint_blue">sample mean</span>, add up the values of all <code class="hint_green"><var>DATA_POINTS</var></code>
                            samples and divide by <code class="hint_green"><var>DATA_POINTS</var></code>.

386.26 	 Find the <span class="hint_purple">squared deviations from the mean</span> for each sample. Since we don't know the
                        population mean, estimate the mean by using the <span class="hint_blue">sample mean</span> we just calculated
                        <code>(\color{<var>BLUE</var>}{\overline{x}} = \color{<var>BLUE</var>}{<var>MEAN</var>\text{ <var>plural( "year", MEAN )</var>}})</code>.

386.27 	 Normally we can find the variance <code>(\color{red}{s^2})</code> by averaging the
                            <span class="hint_purple">squared deviations from the mean</span>. But remember we don't know the real
                            population mean&mdash;we had to estimate it by using the <span class="hint_blue">sample mean</span>.

386.28 	 The age of any particular <var>animal( 1 )</var> in our sample is likely to be closer to the average age
                            of the <var>plural( DATA_POINTS, animal( 1 ) )</var> we sampled than it is to the average age
                            of all <var>plural( POPULATION, animal( 1 ) )</var> in the zoo.
                            Because of that, the <span class="hint_purple">squared deviations from the mean</span> we calculated will
                            probably underestimate the actual deviations from the population mean.

386.29 	 To compensate for this underestimation, rather than simply averaging the <span class="hint_purple">squared deviations from the mean</span>,
                            we total them and divide by <code class="hint_green">n - 1</code>.

386.33 	 <strong>
                        We can estimate that the average <var>animal( 1 )</var> at the zoo is <var>plural( MEAN, "year" )</var> old with a variance
                        of <var>plural( VARIANCE, "year" )</var><code>^2</code>.
