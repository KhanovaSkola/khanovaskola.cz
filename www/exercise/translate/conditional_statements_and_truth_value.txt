72.1 	 Conditional Statements and Truth Value

72.2 	 Assume this first statement is true:

72.4 	 Logically, can you deduce that this second statement must be true from the first one?

72.7 	 Is the second statement the converse, inverse, or contrapositive of the original statement?

72.8 	 The second statement is the <var>STATEMENT_TYPE</var> of the original statement.

72.9 	 The <var>STATEMENT_TYPE</var> is logically equivalent to the original statement, so yes, the second statement can be deduced from the first statement.

72.10 	 The <var>STATEMENT_TYPE</var> is not logically equivalent to the original statement, so no, the second statement cannot be deduced from the first statement.

72.11 	 Assume this original statement below is true:

72.13 	 Choose the statement that must also be true logically:

72.15 	 Only the contrapositive of the original statement must be true.

72.16 	 Find the contrapositive. In other words, find the statement that reverses and negates both the hypothesis and conclusion.

72.17 	 In this case, the contrapositive is <strong>"<var>PROBLEM.contrapositive</var>"</strong>

72.18 	 If the <var>NAMES[CASE]</var> is true, then which other statement must be true logically?

72.19 	 the <var>ANS</var>

72.20 	 The <span class="hint_blue">original</span> conditional statement and its <span class="hint_blue">contrapositive</span> are logically equivalent, and the <span class="hint_green">converse</span> and the <span class="hint_green">inverse</span> are logically equivalent.

72.21 	 Logically equivalent statements have the same truth-value.

72.22 	 Because the <var>NAMES[CASE]</var> is true, the <strong><var>NAMES[3-CASE]</var></strong> is also logically true.
