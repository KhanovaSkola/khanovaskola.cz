197.1 	 Inscribed angles 3

197.2 	 If the <var>GIVEN_LABEL</var> angle measures <var>GIVEN</var> degrees, what does the <var>ASKED_LABEL</var> angle measure?

197.3 	 This is a special case where the center of the circle is outside the inscribed orange angle. The blue angle is called a central angle.

197.4 	 What do we know about the angles formed by the dashed diameter shown above?

197.5 	 From the previous inscribed angles exercises, we know the following about the green and pink angles.

197.7 	 We can see another pair of these special case inscribed and central angles, with the same relationship between green and pink angles.

197.8 	 Looking at the picture, we can see the following is true:

197.10 	 Substituting what we know about green and pink angles, we get the following:

197.13 	 We can see from the picture that the following is also true:

197.16 	 Combining what we know about blue and orange angles:

197.20 	 What do we know about the angles formed by the dashed diameter shown above?

197.21 	 From the previous inscribed angles exercises, we know the following about the green and pink angles.

197.23 	 We can see another pair of these special case inscribed and central angles, with the same relationship between green and pink angles.

197.24 	 Looking at the picture, we can see the following is true:

197.26 	 Substituting what we know about green and pink angles, we get the following:

197.29 	 We can see from the picture that the following is also true:

197.32 	 Combining what we know about blue and orange angles:
