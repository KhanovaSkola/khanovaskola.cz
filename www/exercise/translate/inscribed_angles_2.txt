196.1 	 Inscribed angles 2

196.2 	 If the <var>GIVEN_LABEL</var> angle measures <var>GIVEN</var> degrees, what does the <var>ASKED_LABEL</var> angle measure?

196.3 	 This is a special case where the center of the circle is inside the inscribed orange angle. The blue angle is called a central angle.

196.4 	 What do we know about the sub-angles formed by the dashed diameter shown above?

196.5 	 If we only look at the sub-angles drawn now, we see that this is the special case from the previous inscribed angles exercise!

196.6 	 We know that the orange sub-angle is one half the measure of the blue sub-angle.

196.7 	 Likewise, the other orange sub-angle is one half the measure of the other blue sub-angle, as shown.

196.8 	 If both orange sub-angles are one half both blue sub-angles, then we know that the original orange angle is one half the original blue angle.

196.12 	 What do we know about the sub-angles formed by the dashed diameter shown above?

196.13 	 If we only look at the sub-angles drawn now, we see that this is the special case from the previous inscribed angles exercise!

196.14 	 We know that the orange sub-angle is one half the measure of the blue sub-angle.

196.15 	 Likewise, the other orange sub-angle is one half the measure of the other blue sub-angle, as shown.

196.16 	 If both blue sub-angles are twice both blue sub-angles, then we know that the blue is twice the orange angle.
