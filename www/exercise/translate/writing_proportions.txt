392.1 	 Writing proportions

392.2 	 <var>plural( N1, deskItem( 0 ) )</var> cost $<var>C</var>.

392.3 	 Which equation would help determine the cost of <var>plural( N2, deskItem( 0 ) )</var>?

392.5 	 There are several equations that could help determine the cost, each with a slightly different approach.

392.6 	 We can write the fact that <var>plural( N1, deskItem( 0 ) )</var> cost $<var>C</var> as a proportion:

392.8 	 Let <code>x</code> represent the unknown cost of <var>plural( N2, deskItem( 0 ) )</var>. Since <var>plural( N2, deskItem( 0 ) )</var> cost <code>x</code>, we have the following proportion:

392.10 	 The cost changes along with the number of <var>deskItem( 0 )</var>s purchased, and so the two proportions are equivalent.

392.11 	 Let <code>x</code> represent the unknown cost of <var>plural( N2, deskItem( 0 ) )</var>. Since <var>plural( N2, deskItem( 0 ) )</var> cost <code>x</code>, we have the following proportion:

392.13 	 We can write the fact that <var>plural( N1, deskItem( 0 ) )</var> cost $<var>C</var> as a proportion:

392.15 	 The cost changes along with the number of <var>deskItem( 0 )</var>s purchased, and so the two proportions are equivalent.

392.16 	 We know the cost of <var>plural( N1, deskItem( 0 ) )</var>, and we want to know the cost of <var>plural( N2, deskItem( 0 ) )</var>. We can write the numbers of <var>deskItem( 0 )</var>s as a proportion:

392.18 	 We know <var>plural( N1, deskItem( 0 ) )</var> costs $<var>C</var>, and we can let <code>x</code> represent the unknown cost of <var>plural( N2, deskItem( 0 ) )</var>. The proportion of these costs can be expressed as:

392.20 	 The cost changes along with the number of <var>deskItem( 0 )</var>s purchased, and so the two proportions are equivalent.

392.21 	 If we let <code>x</code> represent the cost of <var>plural( N2, deskItem( 0 ) )</var>, we have the following proportion:

392.23 	 We have to pay $<var>C</var> for <var>plural( N1, deskItem( 0 ) )</var>, and that can be written as a proportion:

392.25 	 Since the price per folder stays the same, these two proportions are equivalent.
