257.1 	 Ordering fractions

257.2 	 Order the following fractions from least to greatest:

257.4 	 Let's use different colors for each fraction.

257.6 	 Find the least common denominator of all the fractions, so that we can compare them more easily.

257.7 	 The least common denominator is the least common multiple of all the denominators.

257.8 	 The least common multiple of <code><var>DENOMS_TEX_COLOR</var></code> is <code><var>LCD</var></code>.

257.9 	 Multiply all the fractions <code>\dfrac{a}{b}</code> by <code>\dfrac{\frac{<var>LCD</var>}{b}}{\frac{<var>LCD</var>}{b}}</code>. Then each fraction will have <code><var>LCD</var></code> as its denominator:

257.11 	 Now all the fractions are in a form where we can compare them by numerator:

257.13 	 Sort the fractions from least to greatest by their numerators:

257.15 	 Finally, reduce each fraction again.
