50.1 	 Changing fractions to decimals 1

50.2 	 Express <code><var>fraction( _N, _D )</var></code> as a decimal.

50.3 	 <code><var>fraction( _N, _D )</var></code> reduces to <code><var>fraction( N, D )</var></code>.

50.4 	 Denominators of 10 or 100 are easy cases: The decimal form is just the numerator with the decimal place moved left by the number of 0s in the denominator.
        <p data-if="D === 10 || D === 100">For this question, this means <var>D === 10 ? "1 place" : "2 places"</var>.

50.5 	 To turn <code><var>fractionSmall( N, D )</var></code> into a decimal, perform long division, dividing <code><var>D</var></code> into <code><var>N</var></code> (if you need help with this, try practicing some Division exercises or watching some related videos).
