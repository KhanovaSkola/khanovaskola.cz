272.1 	 Plotting the line of best fit

272.2 	 Find the line of best fit,
                or mark that there is no linear correlation.

272.3 	 The line of best fit is the line that best approximates
                    the data points.

272.4 	 There are three main criteria to use when finding a good
                        best fit line.

272.5 	 First, make sure that your line passes through the points,
                        and does not lie completely above or below the points.

272.6 	 Next, make sure that your line alternates between
                        passing above and then below points, and doesn't simply
                        go above some points and then below the rest.

272.7 	 Last, make sure that the line goes through the middle
                        of all the points, so that it is close to all of
                        the points.

272.8 	 There are several lines that satisfy this.
                    <input type="submit" value="Click here"
                        onclick="javascript:KhanUtil.tmpl
                            .getVAR('GRAPH').showSolution()"/>
                    to show one of them.

272.9 	 Look at the data, and try to figure out if there is
                    a linear relationship.

272.10 	 Because these data are mostly random, there is no
                    correlation, so no good best fit line exists.
