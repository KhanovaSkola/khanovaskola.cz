290.1 	 Quadrilateral Angles

290.2 	 This figure is a trapezoid.

290.3 	 The angles of a trapezoid side are supplementary.

290.7 	 This figure is an isosceles trapezoid.

290.8 	 The angles of bases of an isosceles trapezoid are equal.

290.9 	 Therefore, the angle x is also <code><var>ANGLES[ SHOWN_POS ]</var></code>

290.10 	 This quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

290.11 	 Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.

290.12 	 Therefore, the angle x is also <code><var>ANGLES[ SHOWN_POS ]</var></code>

290.13 	 This quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

290.14 	 Adjacent angles of a parallelogram are supplementary.

290.18 	 This quadrilateral is a rhombus, because it has all sides equal.

290.19 	 Opposite angles of a rhombus are equal.

290.20 	 Therefore, the angle x is also <code><var>ANGLES[ SHOWN_POS ]</var></code>

290.21 	 This quadrilateral is a rhombus, because it has all sides equal.

290.22 	 Adjacent angles of a rhombus are supplementary.

290.26 	 This quadrilateral is a kite, because it has two pairs of adjacent sides equal.

290.27 	 Angles between the non-equal sides of a kite are equal.

290.28 	 Therefore, the angle x is also <code><var>ANGLES[ SHOWN_POS ]</var></code>
