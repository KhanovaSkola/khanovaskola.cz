158.1 	 Factoring polynomials 1

158.2 	 Factor the following expression:

158.4 	 When we factor a polynomial, we are basically reversing this process of multiplying linear expressions together:

158.7 	 The coefficient on the <code>x</code> term is <code class="hint_green"><var>SIMPLELINEAR</var></code>
                        and the constant term is <code class="hint_blue"><var>SIMPLECONSTANT</var></code>, so to reverse the steps above, we need to find two numbers
                        that <span class="hint_green">add up to <code><var>SIMPLELINEAR</var></code></span> and <span class="hint_blue">multiply to
                        <code><var>SIMPLECONSTANT</var></code></span>.

158.8 	 You can try out different factors of <code class="hint_blue"><var>SIMPLECONSTANT</var></code> to see if you can find two
                    that satisfy both conditions. If you're stuck and can't think of any, you can also rewrite the conditions as a system of equations and
                    try solving for <code class="hint_pink">a</code> and <code class="hint_pink">b</code>:

158.11 	 The two numbers <code class="hint_pink"><var>-A</var></code> and <code class="hint_pink"><var>-B</var></code> satisfy both conditions:

                    So we can factor the expression as: <code>(x <var>A &lt; 0 ? "+" : ""</var> \color{<var>PINK</var>}{<var>-A</var>})
                    (x <var>B &lt; 0 ? "+" : ""</var> \color{<var>PINK</var>}{<var>-B</var>})</code>
