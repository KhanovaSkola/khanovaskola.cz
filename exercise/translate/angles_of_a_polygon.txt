35.1 	 Angles of a polygon

35.2 	 What is the sum of this polygon's interior angles?

35.3 	 There are a couple ways to approach this problem.

35.4 	 Does it help to remember that there are 180 degrees in a triangle?

35.5 	 Since this polygon has <var>SIDES</var> sides, we can draw <var>SIDES</var> triangles that all meet in the center.

35.6 	 We can combine all the triangles' angles, and then we must subtract 360 degrees because the circle in the middle is extra.

35.8 	 An alternative approach is shown below.

35.9 	 We can use four of the <var>cardinal( SIDES )</var> sides to make 2 triangles, as shown in orange.

35.10 	 There <var>plural( "is", SIDES - 4 )</var> <var>plural( SIDES - 4, "side" )</var> between the orange triangles, to make <var>SIDES - 4</var> additional <var>plural( "triangle", SIDES - 4 )</var>.

35.11 	 We chopped this polygon into <var>SIDES - 2</var> triangles, and each triangle's angles sum to 180 degrees.

35.13 	 The sum of the polygon's interior angles is <var>ANSWER</var> degrees.

35.14 	 What is the sum of this polygon's exterior angles?

35.15 	 The exterior angles are shown above.

35.16 	 The exterior angles fit together to form a circle

35.17 	 Therefore, the sum of the exterior angles is 360 degrees.
