349.2 	 What is the length of side AC? (Round to 1 decimal place)

349.3 	 There aren't any similar triangles in the problem figure, but we can make
                            a new triangle with a few lines.<br/>
                            <span style="padding-left:10px;">1. Draw a line parallel to the line
                            <code>\pink{AC}</code>, through the point <code>B</code>.</span><br/>
                            <span style="padding-left:10px;">2. Extend the line <code>AD</code> out
                            to meet it at a new point <code>E</code>.</span>

349.4 	 Now we have a very useful triangle <code class="hint_purple">\triangle BDE</code>
                        which is similar to <code>\triangle ACD</code>.

349.5 	 Since <code>\pink{AC}</code> and <code>BE</code> are parallel, we
                            know that <code class="hint_green">\angle CAE</code>
                            is congruent to <code class="hint_green">\angle AEB</code>.

349.6 	 We can now tell that <code class="hint_green">\text{m}\angle BAE</code>
                            is equal to <code class="hint_green">\text{m}\angle AEB</code>.
                            Meaning <code>\triangle ABE</code> is isosceles, and we know the length
                            of <code class="hint_blue">BE</code>.

349.10 	 What is the length of side AB? (Round to 1 decimal place)

                            Meaning <code>\triangle ACE</code> is isosceles, and we know the length
                            of <code>\blue{CE}</code>.

349.18 	 What is the length of side CD? (Round to 1 decimal place)

                            is congruent to <code class="hint_green">\angle AEC</code>.

349.22 	 We can now see that <code class="hint_green">\text{m}\angle CAE</code>
                            is equal to <code class="hint_green">\text{m}\angle AEC</code>.
