340.2 	 What is the volume of this object?
                Drag on the object to rotate it.

340.3 	 The volume of a prism is the area of the base
                    <code>\times</code> depth.

340.4 	 In this object, one of the triangles is the base.

340.5 	 We know the area of a triangle is
                    <code>\frac{1}{2}\ \text{base} \times \text{height}</code>.

340.6 	 Orient the triangle like this, and find the
                        base and height from the object:

340.7 	 From the object, we find that the base of the triangle
                        is <code><var>BASE</var></code> and the height is
                        <code><var>HEIGHT</var></code>.

340.8 	 The area of the triangle is then
                    <code>\frac{1}{2}<var>BASE</var> \times <var>HEIGHT</var>
                        = <var>BASE * HEIGHT / 2</var></code>.

340.9 	 From the object, we can then find that the depth is
                    <code><var>DEPTH</var></code>.

340.10 	 Then, the final volume is
                    <code><var>BASE * HEIGHT / 2</var> \times <var>DEPTH</var>
                        = <var>BASE * HEIGHT * DEPTH / 2</var>.</code>

340.11 	 What is the volume of this box? Drag on the box to rotate it.

340.12 	 The volume of a box is the
                    length <code>\times</code>
                    width <code>\times</code>
                    height.

340.13 	 From the figure, we can find that the
                    lengths of the sides are
                    <code><var>LENGTH</var></code>,
                    <code><var>WIDTH</var></code>,
                    and <code><var>HEIGHT</var></code>.

340.14 	 To find the volume, we just multiply
                    these side lengths together.

340.17 	 Thus, the volume of the box is
                    <code><var>LENGTH * WIDTH * HEIGHT</var></code>.

340.18 	 What is the surface area of this box?
                Drag on the box to rotate it.

340.19 	 To find the surface area, find the areas
                of each of the faces, and add all the areas up.

340.20 	 To see this better, let's try unwrapping the box:
                    <input type="submit" value="Unwrap!"
                        onclick="KhanUtil.tmpl.getVAR('UNWRAPGRAPH.unwrap()')"
                    />

340.21 	 We can group the faces together
                            based on size and color:

340.22 	 We can calculate the area of each
                            of the pieces now:

340.25 	 Thus, the total surface area of the box is
                        <code><var>2 * WIDTH * HEIGHT +
                                2 * LENGTH * WIDTH +
                                2 * HEIGHT * LENGTH</var></code>.

340.26 	 What is the volume of this cube? Drag on the cube to rotate it.

340.27 	 The volume of a box is the
                    length <code>\times</code>
                    width <code>\times</code>
                    height.

340.28 	 Since this is a cube, all the sides are the same length.

340.29 	 From the figure, we can find that the side length is
                    <code><var>WIDTH</var></code>.

340.30 	 To find the volume, we just cube this side length.

340.33 	 Thus, the volume of the cube is
                    <code><var>WIDTH * WIDTH * WIDTH</var></code>.

340.34 	 What is the surface area of this cube?
                Drag on the cube to rotate it.

340.35 	 Here, we can see that all of the
                        six sides have the same size.

340.36 	 We can now calculate the total area:

340.39 	 Thus, the total surface area of the cube is
                        <code><var>6 * WIDTH * WIDTH</var></code>.

340.40 	 What is the volume of a cylinder with base radius
                    <code><var>r</var></code> and height
                    <code><var>h</var></code>?

340.41 	 <span class="sol" data-forms="pi">
                        <var>Math.PI * r * r * h</var>
                    </span>
                    Cubic Units

340.42 	 The area of the base is simply the area of a circle:
                    <code>\pi r^2 = \pi \cdot <var>r</var>^2 =
                        <var>r * r</var> \pi</code>.

340.43 	 The volume of the cylinder is the area of the base
                    times the height:
                    <code>B \cdot h = <var>r * r</var>\pi \cdot <var>h</var>
                        = <var>r * r * h</var>\pi</code>.

340.44 	 What is the surface area of a cylinder with
                    base radius <code><var>r</var></code> and
                    height <code><var>h</var></code>?

340.45 	 <span class="sol" data-forms="pi">
                        <var>Math.PI * 2 * r * ( r + h )</var>
                    </span>
                    Square Units

340.46 	 The areas of the top and the base are simply the
                    area of a circle:
                    <code>\pi r^2 = \pi \cdot <var>r</var>^2 =
                        <var>r * r</var> \pi</code>.

340.47 	 The lateral surface area is the same as the
                    area of a rectangle with height
                    <code><var>h</var></code>
                    and width equal to the circumference of the base.

340.48 	 That circumference is
                    <code>2 \pi r = 2\pi \cdot <var>r</var> =
                        <var>2 * r</var>\pi</code>.

340.49 	 Thus, the lateral surface area is
                    <code>wh = <var>2 * r</var> \pi \cdot <var>h</var> =
                        <var>2 * r * h</var> \pi</code>.

340.50 	 The total surface area is
                    <code><var>r * r</var> \pi + <var>r * r</var> \pi +
                        <var>2 * r * h</var> \pi =
                        <var>2 * r * ( r + h )</var>\pi</code>.
