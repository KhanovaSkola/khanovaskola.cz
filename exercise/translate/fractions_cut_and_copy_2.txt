165.1 	 Fractions cut and copy 2

165.2 	 The starting block below is <code><var>CODE_PARENT</var></code> units long. Use the tools to the right to convert the starting block into both of the goal blocks that are <code><var>CODE_OFFSPRING_1</var></code> units long and <code><var>CODE_OFFSPRING_2</var></code> units long. You can see your progress as the current blocks.

165.3 	 Starting Block:

165.4 	 Current Block 1:

165.5 	 Goal Block 1:

165.6 	 Current Block 2:

165.7 	 Goal Block 2:

165.8 	 The goal block 1 of length <code><var>CODE_OFFSPRING_1</var></code> units
                    can be rewritten as <code><var>fraction( N_OFFSPRING_1, D_OFFSPRING_1 )</var></code>.

165.9 	 The goal block 1 of length <code><var>CODE_OFFSPRING_2</var></code> units
                    can be rewritten as <code><var>fraction( N_OFFSPRING_2, D_OFFSPRING_2 )</var></code>.

165.10 	 Cutting the starting block into <code>x</code> pieces is the same as dividing it by <code>x</code>.

165.11 	 We want to cut the starting block into a piece that can be copied into both goal block 1 and goal block 2.

165.12 	 The least common denominator of <code><var>D_OFFSPRING_1</var></code> and <code><var>D_OFFSPRING_2</var></code> (the denominators of the goal blocks) is
                    <code><var>LCM</var></code>. Therefore you can copy a block <code>\dfrac{1}{<var>LCM</var>}</code> units long to make both goal blocks.

165.13 	 To find the number of slices to cut the starting block into we solve for <code>s</code> in the following equation:

165.18 	 We now have a resulting block that is <code>\dfrac{1}{<var>LCM</var>}</code> units long. Now we simply divide our goal blocks by this value to see how many times we need to copy the resulting block.

165.21 	 <strong>Therefore the solution is to cut the starting block into <code><var>SLICES</var></code> pieces, copy current block 1 <code><var>N_OFFSPRING_1 * LCM / D_OFFSPRING_1</var></code> times and current block 2 <code><var>N_OFFSPRING_2 * LCM / D_OFFSPRING_2</var></code> times.</strong>
