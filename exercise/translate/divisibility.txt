117.1 	 Divisibility

117.3 	 A number is divisible by another number (a divisor) if its prime factorization contains the prime factorization of the divisor.

117.4 	 The prime factorization of <code><var>A</var></code> is <code><var>getPrimeFactorization( A ).join( "\\times" )</var></code>.

117.5 	 The prime factorization of <code><var>B</var></code> is <code><var>getPrimeFactorization( B ).join( "\\times" )</var></code>.

117.6 	 So, any number divisible by both must have <code><var>LCM_FACTORIZATION.join( "\\times" )</var></code> as part of its prime factorization.

117.7 	 All numbers which divide such a number will have a factorization which is part of <code><var>LCM_FACTORIZATION.join( "\\times" )</var></code>.

117.8 	 The prime factorization of <code><var>ANSWER</var></code> is <code><var>getPrimeFactorization( ANSWER ).join( "\\times" )</var></code>.

117.9 	 Since <code><var>getPrimeFactorization( ANSWER ).join( "\\times" )</var></code> is part of <code><var>LCM_FACTORIZATION.join( "\\times" )</var></code>, all numbers which are divisible by <code><var>A</var></code> and <code><var>B</var></code> are also divisible by <code><var>ANSWER</var></code>.
