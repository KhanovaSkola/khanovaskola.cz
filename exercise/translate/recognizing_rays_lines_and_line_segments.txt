314.1 	 Recognizing rays, lines, and line segments

314.2 	 Identify this figure.

314.3 	 This one-dimensional figure has two endpoints and a set length (it doesn't go on forever).

314.4 	 A 1D figure that has two endpoints and a set length is a <em>line segment</em>.

314.5 	 This figure is one-dimensional and has one endpoint. It goes on forever in the other direction, though.

314.6 	 Therefore, this figure is a <em>ray</em>.

314.7 	 This figure is straight, one-dimensional, and it goes on forever in both directions. It doesn't have any endpoints.

314.8 	 That description means this figure is a <em>line</em>.
