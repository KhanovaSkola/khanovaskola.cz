101.1 	 Derivative intuition

101.2 	 <code class="hint_blue">f(x) = <var>FNXTEXT</var></code>
                        <span id="ddxspan" style="margin-left: 5em; display: none; opacity:0">
                            <code class="hint_orange">\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = <var>DDXTEXT</var></code>
                        </span>

101.3 	 Drag each one of the <var>POINTS.length</var> <span class="hint_orange">orange</span> points up and down
                        to adjust the slope of the corresponding tangent line.

101.4 	 The derivative of a function is defined as the slope of a line tangent to the curve at each point.
                        Adjust the slopes of the lines to visually find the    derivative <code>\frac{d}{dx} f(x)</code> at each point.

101.5 	 The orange curve shows the derivative of <code>f(x)</code>. Drag all of the orange points
                            onto the orange curve. Notice how the tangent lines change as you move the orange dots.
                            Pay attention to the relationship between the tangent lines and the blue curve.
