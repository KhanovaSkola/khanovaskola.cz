238.1 	 Multiplying expressions 0.5

238.5 	 Start by distributing the <code><var>parseFormat( "( #{x} " + signOp( B ) + "#{" + B + "})", [ BLUE, BLUE ] )</var></code>:

238.8 	 Next, distribute the <code class="hint_blue">x</code> and the <code class="hint_blue"><var>B</var></code>:

238.10 	 Notice that by distributing you're really just multiplying each term in the first expression by each term in the second expression.

238.11 	 Simplify:

238.13 	 Keep simplifying to get the final answer:
