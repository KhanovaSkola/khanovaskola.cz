144.1 	 Exploring standard deviation 1

144.2 	 Arrange the <var>POINTS</var> orange sample points in this histogram so the
                        <span class="hint_green">sample standard deviation is approximately <code><var>STDDEV</var></code></span>.

144.3 	 The standard deviation is smaller if the points are closer to the mean.
                        The standard deviation is larger if the points are more spread out.
                        Try moving a point closer to and further away from the
                        <span class="hint_blue">sample mean (<code>\bar{x}</code>)</span> to see how the
                        <span class="hint_green">sample standard deviation (<code>s</code>)</span> is affected.

144.4 	 There are many ways to arrange the points so the sample standard deviation is
                        <span class="hint_green"><code><var>STDDEV</var></code></span>.<br />
