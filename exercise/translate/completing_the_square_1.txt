66.1 	 Completing the square 1

66.2 	 Solve for <code>x</code> by completing the square.

66.4 	 <code>x = \quad</code><span class="entry short"></span><code>\quad \text{or} \quad x = \quad</code><span class="entry short"></span>

66.5 	 <code>x = \quad</code><span class="sol"><var>X1</var></span>

66.6 	 Begin by moving the constant term to the right side of the equation.

66.8 	 We complete the square by taking half of the coefficient of our <code>x</code> term, squaring it, and adding it to both sides of the equation. Since the coefficient of our <code>x</code> term is <code><var>B</var></code>, half of it would be <code><var>B / 2</var></code>, and squaring it gives us <code>\color{blue}{<var>pow( B / 2, 2 )</var>}</code>.

66.10 	 We can now rewrite the left side of the equation as a squared term.

66.12 	 The left side of the equation is already a perfect square trinomial. The coefficient of our <code>x</code> term is <code><var>B</var></code>, half of it is <code><var>B / 2</var></code>, and squaring it gives us <code>\color{blue}{<var>pow( B / 2, 2 )</var>}</code>, our constant term.

66.13 	 Thus, we can rewrite the left side of the equation as a squared term.

66.15 	 Take the square root of both sides.

66.17 	 Isolate <code>x</code> to find the solution(s).
