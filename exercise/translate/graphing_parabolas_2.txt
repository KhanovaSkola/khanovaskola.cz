181.1 	 Graphing parabolas 2

181.2 	 Graph the following equation:

181.4 	 We could try plugging in some different <code>x</code>-values, but instead of guessing it might be easier to
                    convert the equation to vertex form.

181.5 	 Convert the equation to vertex form by completing the square. [<a href="#" class="show-subhint" data-subhint="complete-square">Show me how</a>]

181.6 	 First, move the constant term to the left side of the equation:

181.8 	 Next, we can factor out a <code><var>A</var></code> from the right side:

181.10 	 We can complete the square by taking half of the coefficient of our x term, squaring it, and adding it to both sides of the equation.
                            The coefficient of our x term is <code><var>-2 * H</var></code>, so half of it would be <code><var>-H</var></code>,
                            and squaring that gives us <code class="hint_blue"><var>H * H</var></code>. <span data-if="A !== 1">Because we're adding the <code><var>H * H</var></code>
                            inside the parentheses on the right where it's being multiplied by <code><var>A</var></code>, we need to add <code class="hint_blue"><var>A * H * H</var></code>
                            to the left side to make sure we're adding the same thing to both sides.</span>

181.12 	 Now we can rewrite the expression in parentheses as a squared term:

181.14 	 Move the constant term to the right side of the equation. Now the equation is in vertex form:

181.17 	 When the equation is written in vertex form like this, the vertex is the point <code class="hint_green">(h, k)</code>:
                    <p><code>\qquad <var>formatGroup( GROUP1, [ 0 ] )</var></code>

181.19 	 Examining our equation, we can see the vertex of the parabola is at <code class="hint_green">(<var>H</var>, <var>K</var>)</code>.

181.20 	 To find another point on the parabola, we can try plugging an <code>x</code> value into the equation.

181.21 	 Since the vertex is at <code class="hint_green">x = <var>H</code></code>, let's try one unit to the right and evaluate
                        the equation at <code class="hint_pink">x = <var>X1</var></code>.

181.23 	 Another point on the parabola is <code class="hint_pink">(<var>X1</var>, <var>Y1</var>)</code>
                    <div class="graphie" data-update="grid">
                        style({
                            stroke: PINK,
                            strokeWidth: 3
                        }, function() {
                            line( [ X1 - 0.3, Y1 - 0.3 ], [ X1 + 0.3, Y1 + 0.3 ] ).toBack();
                            line( [ X1 - 0.3, Y1 + 0.3 ], [ X1 + 0.3, Y1 - 0.3 ] ).toBack();
                        });
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>A parabola has an <span class="hint_green">axis of symmetry</span> that passes through its vertex.

181.24 	 Because the parabola is symmetric, we can reflect the point <code class="hint_pink">(<var>X1</var>, <var>Y1</var>)</code>
                        across the <span class="hint_green">axis of symmetry</span> to get another point,
                        <code class="hint_orange">(<var>X2</var>, <var>Y2</var>)</code>, that must
                        also be on the parabola.

181.25 	 There is only one graph of a parabola that passes through all three points we found.
