81.1 	 Converting between slope intercept and standard form

81.2 	 Convert the following equation from standard form to slope intercept form.

81.3 	 In other words, if the equation is rewritten to look like <code>y = mx + b</code>, what are the values of <code>m</code> and <code>b</code>?

81.5 	 <code>m</code> = <span class="sol"><var>SLOPE</var></span>

81.6 	 <code>b</code> = <span class="sol"><var>Y_INTERCEPT</var></span>

81.7 	 Move the <code>x</code> term to the other side of the equation.

81.9 	 Divide both sides by <code><var>B</var></code>.

81.11 	 Inspecting the equation in slope intercept form, we see the following.

81.13 	 Behold! The magic of math, that both equations could represent the same line!

81.14 	 Convert the following equation from slope intercept form to standard form.

81.15 	 In other words, if the equation is rewritten to look like <code>Ax + By = C</code>, what are the values of <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>?

81.16 	 Assume <code>A</code> is positive.

81.18 	 <code>A</code> = <span class="sol"></span>

81.19 	 <code>B</code> = <span class="sol"></span>

81.20 	 <code>C</code> = <span class="sol"></span>

81.21 	 Move the <code>x</code> term to the same side as the <code>y</code> term.

81.23 	 Since the slope is <code>0</code> and there is no <code>x</code> term, the equation is already in slope intercept form.

81.25 	 Multiply both sides by <code>-1</code> so that <code>A</code> will be positive

81.27 	 Inspecting the equation in standard form, we see the following.

81.29 	 Behold! The magic of math, that both equations could represent the same line!
