203.9 	 Solve for <code><var>UNKNOWN</var></code>. Round to the nearest tenth.

203.10 	 Make sure you select the proper units. You may do arithmetic with a calculator. If there is more than one correct solution, you may enter either one.

203.35 	 By the quadratic formula:

203.38 	 The quadratic has two solutions. Without making any assumptions about the direction of <code>v_i</code>,
                        either one could be correct. Intuitively, you can imagine throwing an object upward or downward in such a way
                        that they will both have the same downward velocity at the same point in space, but the one thrown downward
                        will get there sooner.

203.51 	 By the quadratic formula:

203.54 	 The quadratic has two solutions. Without making any assumptions about the direction of <code>v_f</code>,
                        either one could be correct. Intuitively, this is because an object moving upward at velocity <code>v</code>
                        at one point in time will eventually be falling at the same speed (<code>-v</code>) at a different point in time.

203.75 	 Without making any assumptions about <code>t</code>, either direction for <code>v_i</code> could be correct.
                        Imagine throwing an object upward at velocity <code>v</code> compared to throwing it downward at the same
                        speed (<code>-v</code>). In both cases it will reach the same final velocity <code>v_f</code> at the same
                        point in space; it will just take different amounts of time to get there.

203.77 	 However, we also know <code>a = 0 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}</code>

203.78 	 We know intuitively that with zero acceleration <code>v_i</code> must equal <code>v_f</code>, so <code>v_i = <var>roundTo(1, V_INIT)</var> \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}</code>

203.81 	 Without making any assumptions about <code>t</code>, either direction for <code>v_f</code> could be correct.
                        Imagine an object traveling upward at velocity <code>v_i</code>. It will reach a particular velocity
                        <code>v</code> on the way up, then reach the same speed in the opposite direction (<code>-v</code>) on the
                        way down at the same point in space; it will just take a different amount of time to get there.

203.83 	 However, we also know <code>a = 0 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}</code>

203.84 	 We know intuitively that with zero acceleration <code>v_f</code> must equal <code>v_i</code>, so <code>v_f = <var>roundTo(1, V_FINAL)</var> \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}</code>
