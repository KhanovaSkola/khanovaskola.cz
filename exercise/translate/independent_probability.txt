193.1 	 Free throw probability

193.2 	 What is the percent probability of <var>PLAYER</var> making ALL of his next
                <var>STREAK</var> free throw attempts?

193.3 	 Round your answer to one decimal place.<br />
                    Use the information in the following table to help answer the question:

193.4 	 By looking through the table, we know that the probability of
                    <var>PLAYER</var> making <b>one</b> free throw is
                    <span class="hint_blue"><var>SINGLE_PCT</var>%</span>.

193.5 	 So <span class="hint_blue"><var>SINGLE_PCT</var>%</span> of the time, he'll make
                    his first shot. Then <span class="hint_blue"><var>SINGLE_PCT</var>%</span> of
                    the time he makes the first shot, he will also make his second shot.

193.6 	 So the chance of making <b>two</b> free throws in a row is
                    <code>\blue{<var>SINGLE_PCT</var>\%} \times \blue{<var>SINGLE_PCT</var>\%}</code>, or
                    <code>\blue{<var>PROB</var>} \times \blue{<var>PROB</var>}</code>.

193.7 	 The chance of making <b>three</b> free throws in a row is
                    <code>\blue{<var>PROB</var>} \times \blue{<var>PROB</var>} \times \blue{<var>PROB</var>}</code>,
                    and so on.

193.8 	 So the chance of <var>PLAYER</var> making all <code class="hint_green"><var>STREAK</var></code>
                    free throw attempts in a row is <code>\blue{<var>PROB</var>}^{\green{<var>STREAK</var>}}</code>.

193.9 	 <code>\blue{<var>PROB</var>}^{\green{<var>STREAK</var>}} \approx
                    <var>roundTo(3, pow(PROB, STREAK))</var></code>.

193.10 	 The chance of <var>PLAYER</var> making his next <var>STREAK</var> free throw
                    attempts is approximately <var>SOLUTION</var>%.
